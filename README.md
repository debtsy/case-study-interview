# Pull Request Case Study

## Background Context
You currently run a small engineering team building a full stack 
application for Apex Financial Group, a fintech start up that offers 
low-interest credit cards. AFG needs a tool to manage their cardholders 
and check on a regular basis which cardholders have fallen behind on their 
monthly payments. This tool is currently being developed, and 
currently has a very basic search page that allows a user to enter in 
search parameters to get a list of cardholder accounts that match.

Alice, a junior engineer on your team, has been tasked with adding to 
that feature. Her project includes:

- Creating an account details page that displays information about the 
  cardholder:
- Creating a history table that shows when the cardholder has made 
  payments on their card
- Adding some new columns to the initial search page to show a card's 
  overdue balance (if any) as well as a column for how many days this card 
  balance is overdue
- Creating the necessary backend methods and API calls that support this 
  new feature

She's been struggling with completing this task, and has been more than a week 
delayed in finishing up this project. She has also not proactively raised
issues or blockers with her tasks.

## Requirements
- Review Alice's PR thoroughly with suggestions of improvement
- Write out how you would approach Alice in a 1-1 review of her work

## Additional Guidance
- Please don't spend more than 2 hours on this task
- Please be thorough and detailed in how you would deliver 1-1 feedback, 
  but this should not be longer than 1 page
