# Pull Request Case Study

## Background Context
You currently run a small engineering team building a full stack application for Apex Financial Group, a fintech start up that offers low-interest credit cards. AFG needs a tool to manage their borrowers and check on a regular basis which borrowers have fallen behind on their monthly payments. This tool is currently under development, and a very basic search page has been built that allows a user to enter in search parameters to get a list of card holder accounts that match.  

Alice, a junior engineer on your team, has been tasked with adding to that feature. Her project includes: 
- Creating an account details page that displays information about the cardholder:
- Creating a history table that shows when the cardholder has made payments on their card
- Adding some new columns to the initial search page to show a card's overdue balance (if any) as well as a column for how many days this card balance is overdue
- Creating the necessary backend methods and API calls that support this new feature
